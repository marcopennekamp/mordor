This is the test area. Every test in the folder tests will be compiled and run by mordor.
Every test has to pass, otherwise something is wrong with mordor. Like normal testing, it
should give a hint when something is wrong, which is especially crucial with interpreters.

To test the whole software simply execute "test.bat".
